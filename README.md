# Redis SpeedSheet

The Redis speedsheet covers all operations of the Redis in memory database. The speedsheet is hosted on [speedsheet.io](https://speedsheet.io). This is the raw content for that speedsheet.

# Status

Content: Basics

This contains the very basics of Redis commands. It'll get you going but definitely needs a lot more.

We love speedsheets and we'd love to have them for every language and library out there. But we don't have remotely enough time for all the great docs we want to create. If you would like to help, you can submit updates right here. It would be greatly appreciated! 

And thanks!
